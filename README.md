Data Science &amp; Analytics Internship Tasks completed during my internship at DevelopersHub Corporation (Due: 14 August 2025)
# 🌸 Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset

## 📌 Internship Program:
**DevelopersHub Corporation – Data Science & Analytics Internship**  
**Due Date:** 14th August, 2025

---

## 🎯 Objective
This task focuses on reading, understanding, and visualizing the **Iris flower dataset** using Python. It helps build foundational skills in data exploration and visualization using popular libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

---

## 📂 Dataset Used
The **Iris dataset** includes measurements for 150 iris flowers across three species (*setosa, versicolor, virginica*). Features include:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (Target variable)

This dataset is easily accessible through the `seaborn` library.

---

## 🔧 Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading**
   - Loaded the dataset using `pandas`
   - Viewed basic structure using `.shape`, `.columns`, and `.head()`

2. **Data Summary**
   - Checked missing values and data types
   - Described dataset statistics with `.describe()`

3. **Data Visualization**
   - 📈 **Scatter Plot**: Analyzed relationships between features
   - 📊 **Histogram**: Observed distribution of individual features
   - 📦 **Box Plot**: Detected outliers and spread

---

## 📊 Visualizations (with Libraries)

| Chart | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Scatter Plot | To see how petal/sepal length & width relate across species |
| Histogram | To observe the spread and frequency of each numeric feature |
| Box Plot | To detect outliers and understand feature ranges |

**Libraries Used:**
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib.pyplot`
- `seaborn`

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Petal length and width** are strong indicators of flower species.
- **Setosa** is clearly separable from other species based on its feature values.
- Data is clean and well-distributed; no missing values found.

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Data Loading & Inspection using `pandas`
- Basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `Task_1_Iris_Dataset_Exploration.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook
- `README.md` – Project overview and instructions
