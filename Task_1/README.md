# 🌸 Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset

## 📌 Internship:
**DevelopersHub Corporation – Data Science & Analytics Internship**  
**Due Date:** 14th August, 2025

---

## 🎯 Objective

This task focuses on analyzing and visualizing the **Iris flower dataset** using Python. The goal is to understand the dataset structure, explore relationships between features, and identify patterns through visualizations.

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

The **Iris dataset** contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three species:

- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

### Features:

| Feature        | Description               |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| sepal_length   | Sepal length in cm        |
| sepal_width    | Sepal width in cm         |
| petal_length   | Petal length in cm        |
| petal_width    | Petal width in cm         |
| species        | Type of iris flower       |

## 🔧 Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

---

## 📊 Tasks Performed

- Loaded the dataset using seaborn
- Inspected data structure using `.shape`, `.columns`, `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`
- Checked for missing values
- Visualized data using:
  - **Scatter Plot** – to explore relationships between features
  - **Histogram** – to observe distribution
  - **Box Plot** – to detect outliers

---

## 📈 Visual Insights

- **Petal measurements** (length & width) are key features that differentiate species.
- **Setosa** is clearly distinguishable based on visual analysis.
- Data is clean, with no missing values.
